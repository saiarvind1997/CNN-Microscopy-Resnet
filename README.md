# pretrained_microscopy_models

Software tools to build deep learning microscopy segmentation and analysis models with less training data. Pretrained MicroNet encoders are available for download. Leverages transfer learning from classification models trained on a large (>100,000 images) dataset of microscopy images. <br>
